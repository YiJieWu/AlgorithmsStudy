Random Variable

A random variable is actually a function that map the outcomes of a random process to a numeric value. 
For instance, let's say we have the random process of flipping a coin where the coin can only have one 
of two outcomes - head or a tail.

Probability

The probability of any outcome of a random phenomenon is the proportion of times
the outcome would occur in a very long series of repetitions.

Distribution

A probability distribution is a table or an equation that links each outcome of a 
statistical experiment with its probability of occurrence.

PMF and PDF

If a random variable X has a discrete distribution,
the probability function (abbreviated p.f.) of X is defined 
as the function f such that for every real number x,
f (x) = Pr(X = x).

Conclusion, if you are a P.F/PDF of a random variable, you can 
easily calculate its probability of something!!!!!!

CDF

Cumulative distribution function 
F (x) = Pr(X ≤ x) for −∞ <x< ∞

It should be emphasized that the cumulative distribution function is defined as above
for every random variable X, regardless of whether the distribution of X is discrete,
continuous, or mixed. 


Gaussian/Normal Distribution

. How to describe a normal distribution
N(mean,standard deviation)
where standard deviation is squared root of variance

. What is z-score
Used to denote how many standard deviations the original observation falls 
away from the mean

Equation: The z score of data poin x is 
          
       (x-mean)/standard deviation
